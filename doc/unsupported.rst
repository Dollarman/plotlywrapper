Unsupported Features
====================

Plotlywrapper implements a small subset of Plotly's API.
If Plotlywrapper doesn't support a feature you want it still tries to be useful for you.
It can be handy to use Plotlywrapper to generate the boilerplate data structures for your plot,
then you can tweak the data structures with the options you want.
